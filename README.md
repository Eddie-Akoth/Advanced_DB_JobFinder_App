## Description
We seek to develop a mobile application that simplifies the job search process, one that will help job seekers to efficiently access and apply to  job opportunities while also providing employers a platform to post their job openings for job seekers to apply. This is being done with the aim of increasing transparency in the job application process, increasing employersâ€™ access to talent pools and reducing unemployment by improving peoples access to vacant job positions. The app will be aimed at individuals looking to enter the job market and will be completed by the end of April.
